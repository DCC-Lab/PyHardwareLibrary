# Supporting the Ocean Insight QEPro

The QE Pro from Ocean Insight is a spectacular spectrometer with great sensitivity for Raman.  My Lab bought one recently.  Not cheap, but worth it. It so happens that it also uses the OceanView software, which I strongly believe was written on a friday night before a long week-end by a bunch of monkeys on crack.  I will therefore try to integrate it to my `OISpectrometer` class in `PyHardwareLibrary`.

I am chronicling the story of how I will end up supporting the QE Pro.  This will provide an idea of the process to whoever is hoping to the same with another device.

### Manual

First thing: get the OEM manual, where all the commands are written.  I already have the [OEM manuals](../manuals/) from all the other spectrometers (USB2000, USB4000, etc...) but as much as they feel similar, there are significant differences.  I could not find the manual on [Ocean Insight's web site](https://www.oceaninsight.com/support/documents-manuals/).  I could not find it on google either.  I sent a [Technical Request](https://www.oceaninsight.com/support/faqs/supportrma-request-form/) via the web site. I got a reply within 24 hours with the manuals, which are not made public by default anymore. I saved the OEM version in the [manuals](../manuals/) section of `PyHardwareLibrary`.

A quick look shows it will be a significant undertaking because the structure of commands has changed completely from the USB2000 and USB4000:

The PDF version I have is corrupted (Acrobat and Preview on macOS):

On Windows I was able to read the information partially but sufficiently to understand that I did not have more info about endpoints:

So contrary to other spectrometers, the manual appears a bit incomplete with no discussion on endpoints. Other manuals did specifically mention endpoints and where commands needed to be sent. I will probably need to figure this out by trial and error.

## May 4th 2021

The general aspects of the protocol appear well documented:

### Protocol and message layout information

Now, down to the details of the USB Communication, we send messages of the form:

There are two types of messages: commands (no reply) and queries (reply).  It is possible to force a reply from the commands:

### USB information

The manual says:

I connected the device on a computer which had `PyHardwareLibrary` installed, and I ran `print(usb.core.find(idVendor=0x2457))`. I obtained the complete **USB Descriptor**:

       wMaxPacketSize   :   0x40 (64 bytes)
       bInterval        :    0x0
```



So configuring the USB device should be very straightforward: first and only config, first and only interface. So the next step will be to build a message structure (`NamedTuple`) , and plan the functions for `packing/unpacking` messages.

I received an updated manual from Gamble Techologies. It has been copied to the manuals directory.
